5. **Air dry**: Heat damages elastic fibers

### Storage Tips

- Rotate between multiple bras
- Keep in a cool, dry place

### When to Replace

Replace your sports bra when:

- Straps become loose

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Wearing the wrong size**: Get professionally fitted
2. **Using one bra for all activities**: Different sports need different support
3. **Ignoring fabric care**: Proper care extends bra life
4. **Keeping bras too long**: Replace when support diminishes
5. **Choosing style over function**: Prioritize support and comfort

## Conclusion

Choosing the right sports bra is an investment in your comfort, health, and athletic performance. By understanding your support needs, activity requirements, and proper fit, you can find sports bras that enhance your workout experience.

Remember that the best sports bra is one that you forget you're wearing â€“ it should provide support without restriction, comfort without compromise, and confidence without question.
